Description: 
    Fit elastic-net regularised two-class logistic regressions with double cross validation.
    The double cross-validation has two functions:
    1) selects elastic-net hyperparameters (alpha and lambda)
        by inner cross-validation.
    2) Produces rigorous estimates of out-of-sample classification performance 
        by an independent outer cross-validation.
