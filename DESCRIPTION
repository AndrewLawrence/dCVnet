Description: A wrapper for glmnet to fit elasticnet regularised two-class logistic regresion.
    The double cross-validation has two functions. 
    1) selects elasticnet hyperparameters (alpha and lambda) by (inner) cross-validation.
    2) Produces rigorous estimates of out-of-sample classification performance 
    via an independent (outer) cross-validation.
