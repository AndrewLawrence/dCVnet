This vignette will demonstrate the options provided for imputation in dCVnet.

Start by loading the prostate dataset (see the "prostate" dCVnet example for more details) and artificially remove some predictor data.

```{r setup}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(suppressWarnings(library(tidyverse)))
library(dCVnet)
theme_set(theme_light())

data("prostate", package = "dCVnet")
# extract outcome y and predictor matrix x:
y <- prostate[, 1]
x <- prostate[, c(-1, -10)]

# make a version of x with ~10% missing values:
xmiss <- x
xmiss$lcp[c(39, 64, 71, 74, 75, 76, 83, 88, 94, 95)] <- NA

# Specifically, this removes ten of the larger values of lcp
#   we do this to show the result clearly.
#   lcp was chosen because:
#   1) lcp is a strong predictor
#       (missing values in irrelevant predictors will matter less)
#   2) lcp is correlated quite strongly (~0.67) with svi
#       (so conditional imputation models will be able to use svi, and other
#        features, to impute missing lcp)

# Plot to show the missing values of lcp in context of svi:
prostate %>%
  cbind(., missingness = is.na(xmiss$lcp)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = lcp, x = as.factor(svi), colour = missingness)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("svi")

```

Next we will develop and cross-validate a dCVnet model and fit it to the full dataset. This result will then be compared with a complete cases approach which excludes observations with any missing variables, and three varieties of imputation in dCVnet.

```{r fit_models, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Note: the models take a long time to fit, so this vignette loads stored
#       results so it compiles quickly.
model_settings <- data.frame(
  labels = c("orig", "cc", "meanimp", "knnimp", "rfimp"),
  data = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 2),
  use_imp = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE),
  imp_meth = rep(c("mean", "knn", "missForestPredict"), times = c(3, 1, 1))
)

data_list <- list(x, xmiss)

models <- map(set_names(seq.int(nrow(model_settings)), model_settings$labels),
              ~ dCVnet(
                y = y,
                data = data_list[model_settings$data[.x]],
                f = "~.",
                family = "gaussian",
                alphalist = 1.0,
                k_inner = 10,
                k_outer = 10,
                nrep_inner = 25,
                nrep_outer = 25,
                opt.use_imputation = model_settings$use_imp[.x],
                opt.imputation_method = model_settings$imp_meth[.x]
              ))

cv_rmse_results <- map_dfr(
  models,
  ~ report_performance_summary(.x, short = TRUE) %>%
    filter(Measure == "RMSE") %>%
    select(mean, sd),
  .id = "model"
)

```

```{r load_results, include=FALSE}


cv_rmse_results <- structure(list(
  model = c("orig", "cc", "meanimp", "knnimp", "rfimp"),
  mean = c(
    0.739631127378644,
    0.773580289068649,
    0.776861612118786,
    0.759540904081737,
    0.756714809471389
  ),
  sd = c(
    0.0116423343714006,
    0.0146832811277592,
    0.0114885054274784,
    0.011323831581812,
    0.0109847869670491
  )
),
class = "data.frame",
row.names = c(NA, -5L))

```

Now, inspect the output:

```{r inspect}
cv_rmse_results %>% knitr::kable(digits = 3)

cv_rmse_results %>%
  mutate(model = factor(model, levels = model)) %>%
  mutate(imputation = factor(model %in% c("orig", "cc"),
                             levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),
                             labels = c("no", "yes"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = mean,
             ymin = mean - 2 * sd,
             ymax = mean + 2 * sd,
             x = model,
             colour = imputation)) +
  geom_errorbar(width = 0.2) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(no = "darkblue", yes = "darkred")) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("CV-RMSE") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

Relative to the non-missing data ("orig"), the exclusion of the subjects with missing data (the "cc" or complete-cases analysis) has a negative effect on the CV prediction performance (RMSE) and increases the variability of results over CV-repetitions.

Mean imputation does not noticeably de-bias performance back towards the "true" non-missing model, but it does narrow the variability.

In contrast, the k-nearest neighbours and random-forest imputation approaches brings the mean CV-prediction performance closer to the "true" non-missing model's performance (albeit not perfectly) and also narrows the variability to that of the "true" data.

In this simulation we show prediction models using conditional single imputation (knn or random forest) show cross-validated results closer to complete data than mean imputation or complete-cases excluding the 10% of subjects with missing values.

Note that the simulation is only an illustration, the values were removed with a Missing at Random mechanism. This was deliberate to favour imputation. Missing Completely At Random data would classically produce unbiased coefficients under a complete-cases analysis and so not benefit from imputation. While Missing Not At Random missingness would be expected to not approach ideal performance with either complete-cases or imputation. Also note that the predictors with missing data had other predictors that were good indicators of them - i.e. there was some multicollinearity/redundancy where it mattered. In a study where predictors were uncorrelated we should not expect this form of imputation to be useful (but also probably not harmful).

## dCVnet Imputation Details

dCVnet supports single imputation methods. Imputation is either unconditional ("mean") or conditional, with either the k-nearest neighbour method ("knn", from the caret package, averaging missing values from the k=5 nearest observations), or using the "missForestPredict" approach to missing data employing iterative random forests.

Imputation is conducted on the x-matrix of predictor variables and occurs *after* expansion for formula terms; e.g. `poly(age,2)` produces two variables for a single predictor column called age. For the cross-validated outputs of dCVnet (i.e. excluding the production model) imputation is conducted independently for each fold of the repeated k-fold CV.

All imputation methods in dCVnet allow "prediction" i.e. we generate an imputation "model" on the training dataset then apply the imputation model to the held-out dataset to impute missing data there. Specifically, for **mean imputation** this is as simple as imputing missing held-out data with the mean calculated from the test data. For **knn imputation** it means each held-out subject with missing data has their nearest-neighbours identified from the train dataset. For [**missForest**](https://github.com/stekhoven/missForest) **imputation** we use the [missForestPredict](https://github.com/sibipx/missForestPredict) package to allow prediction of the held-out data from the train data imputation model.

In contrast, as **production model** is fitted to the full dataset it applies the requested imputation on the full dataset. The dCVnet object then includes this full-data imputation model, and using the `predict.dCVnet` method will apply this imputation model to replace missing data in the data predictions are requested for.

### Imputation: Outcome

dCVnet presently does not use the outcome (`y`) in the imputation model. When a prediction model is eventually employed we will not have access to the true y label, and so any improvement in performance due to using y in imputation will not be expected to generalise. However, the development of the model may be improved by including y (this distinction is sometimes called pragmatic vs. ideal performance in prediction modelling) and in future imputation using y may be added.
