\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{\link{dCVnet}} object}

\item{type}{How to display coefficients.
passed to \code{\link{coef.dCVnet}} .
\itemize{
\item{\code{"all"} - boxplot of coefficients for each rep/fold.}
\item{\code{"rep"} - boxplot of mean coefficients for each rep
(mean average over folds).}
\item{\code{"mean"} - dotplot of the mean of \code{"rep"}.}
\item{\code{"median"} - dotplot of the median of \code{"rep"}.}
}}

\item{ordered}{sort predictors by size?}

\item{abs}{plot absolute values?}

\item{intercept}{include the value of the intercept coefficient in the plot?}

\item{prod}{add the production model coefficients as an overlay?
(note: this is not in the data returned by this function,
but can be accessed with \code{coef(object, type = "production")})}

\item{prod_col}{colour for production model coefficients}

\item{prod_shape}{shape for production model coefficients}

\item{panel_scaling}{for multi-outcome coefficients (mgaussian, multinomial).
Should y-axes be independent, or same over all panels.}

\item{plot}{(bool) should the plot also be rendered (\code{TRUE})?,
or just returned as a R object (\code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
a list containing the plot and a data.frame used to plot
(full data.frame is returned, i.e. ignores n.random)
}
\description{
Plot showing standardised betas for outer-loop model coefficients.
Because each fold/repetition of the outerloop can have
completely different amounts and types of regularisation
this should be interpreted with caution.
}
\details{
Warning: do not use these plots to select a subset of variables and
re-run dCVnet.
These coefficients are based on the complete dataset
and using the output of dCVnet to select variables will produce
optimism in cross-validated estimates of performance.
